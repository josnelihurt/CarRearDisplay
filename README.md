# CarRearDisplay

This project is inteded to create a display that will be placed in the rear mirror. Using this I will send information to the driver that is behind me. For now I will use a simple jy-mcu_3208 with a personal modification.
I will use an esp8266 that will be connected to a phone that provides it with internet. The esp8266 will use mqtt to recieve messages to display. As GUI I will program an IOS application.

This project is just for fun. I'm trying to be more ordered with my personal projects beacause I use to lost them. 

If any one looks this interesting and wananna contact me this feel free to contact me.
